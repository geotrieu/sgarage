<h6> A garage where you will never leave open again. </h6>

As young engineers, we aspire to learn and become a more skilled individual. As our journey to learn and joined QHacks 2020 we wanted something simple yet has a huge impact on the community. After brainstorming we came up with sGarage and it is an application that helps identify car drivers if they left the garage open.

We created an application that uses an ultrasonic sensor and detects whether the garage door was left open. This will help drivers be able to continue with their daily commute without the stress of whether they left the door open.

For the software portion of this project, we used Flutter and Dart. Flutter helps make both Android and iOS applications without the hassle of developing them on Android Studio and xCode. Dart is the programming language that Flutters uses to be able to compile code. For the hardware portion, we used an ESP8266 to control the servo motor and ultrasonic sensor.

This application is a proof of concept and there are many innovations that are planned. For starters, there will be a better map added into the application to allow the application to tell where the user is and if he gets too far and the garage is still not closed it will close.
